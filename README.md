A Simple Customization Vehicle Menu for the ONX PD/EMS Pack

I realized a lot of menus out there don’t have the essentials for the ONX Cars like VMT_Lightbar. Naturally, at 3 a.m., my brain decided that sleep was overrated and threw this together instead. When I woke up the next day, I couldn’t be bothered to clean up some of the code, but hey, here it is anyway.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**  
This isn’t a full customization menu. It’s strictly for **cosmetics** on the ONX Cars, so some labels may not make sense if you try to use it on a different PD/EMS car, and the callsign feature won’t work outside its intended setup.
